## Project Summary

Based on the time delays and cancellations data, our project provides users with predictions on the possibility of delays and cancellations for their own traveling. The most frequently given reasons, as well as durations, for those delays/cancellation are also shown to users.


For example, if one wants to travel from airport A to airport B in January, then our application would give users the shortest possible time for his/her flight, the possibility for their flight to be canceled, the reasons for delay, and the best airline to fly on. Users can also see alternate airports they can fly from based on their location and destination.


For the creative components, we want to directly provide the users a specific probability of delay using a weather component to find how often a flight is delayed given a certain weather condition.
